# Project-de-fin-de-parcours
Project de fin de parcours:  "From Pseudocode to Code".

By using this pseudocode to python code translation system, we can easily write the pseudocode in the txt file and get the corresponding python code by launching the translation system.

# The construction of our system
Pseudocode_textX.tx which is written in textX grammer.

hello.py which we used to get the textX model and translate the pseudocode to python code.

demo is the file which we write the pseudocodes.

We combine the three files together, and run the python code, we can get the translated pseudocode (python code) in the command line
After we finish the system, we will have a small plateform which allows us to translate the code from pseudocode to python code.
